# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer
`element.append()` adds the passed in data to the element, it's different from `element.appendChild()` because  `element.appendChild()` only allows for one argument while `element.append()` can have many arguments passed in.
