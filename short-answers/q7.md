# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
1. It's allowing for module exports, which means it will run code from other js files if they are connected through an export/import 

2. You can only have to run that one js file, instead of connecting multiple to your HTML page.
